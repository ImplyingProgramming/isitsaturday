Wanna see some really ugly code? You've come to the right place my son. This app uses timezonedb.com to fetch the time in Kimiliba or whatever that place is called I forgot and don't give a fuck. It says it in the request call. Feel free to improve on this or point out why it's going to fail on Saturday.
